# Scrapping FPV Pilot's Instagram


## Introduction:
Commissioned by the FPV marketing team, the objective was to scrape information from FPV pilot's Instagram pages to facilitate the process of identifying ideal candidates for sponsorship opportunities. To achieve this, I developed an Instagram scraper that takes an Instagram profile link as input and outputs an Excel file containing metrics. Subsequently, the data was cleaned and organized into a JSON file for streamlined access and analysis. Additionally, a simple data visualization was created using Jupyter Notebook to provide a visual representation of the gathered information.

## Project Components:
---
### Input: 

* Instagram profile link of FPV pilots.
Output: An Excel file containing the following metrics:
* URL
* Handle ID
* Follower count
* Following count
* Post count
* Description

## Data Cleaning:
----
The scraped data underwent a cleaning process to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Irrelevant or redundant information was removed, and missing values were handled appropriately.
